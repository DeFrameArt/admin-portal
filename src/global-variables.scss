//global-variables.scss is for important styling variables not defined in default-overrides.scss. Whereas default-overrides is to inject custom values into the installed material design theme, global-variables is used to store styling values that repeat accross multiple stylesheets.

//e.g if you have a custom colour value that is required in different stylesheets, put it here under a variable name like the one below.

$dark-bg-color:rgba(82, 70, 83, 1);

//then refer to it using $dark-bg-color in the stylesheet
//remember to import this stylesheet at the top using @import
